# Server Rules
### Rule 1: Respect the service that we use.
Follow Discord TOS and don’t post anything illegal.

### Rule 2: Respect other members of the server.
Treat everyone kindly. This server does not tolerate any form of harassment or bullying.

### Rule 3: Respect the rules.
By joining the server, you agree to follow the rules and respect the mods that enforce these rules in order to make sure everyone has a good experience. Don’t exploit grey areas in the phrasing. You’re free to ask mods for proof and justifications of their moderation decisions, but respect their final judgment.

# Content Policy
Content NOT ALLOWED in the server will be defined in the following categories:

### A. Illegal or against Discord TOS
A common but *non-exhaustive* list of content that violates Discord’s Terms of Service, and is therefore not allowed in this server:
- Doxxing, or leaking other people’s personal information without their permission. As for handling your own personal info, you are encouraged not to reveal more than necessary in order to *keep yourself safe*.
- Organization of raids, both in the sense of raiding this server or using this server as a place to communicate about raiding other places. This is considered brigading.
- Posting of illegal content including but not limited to IRL gore, animal abuse, sexual abuse, sexualization and exploitation of minors, trading in black markets, and violent crime-related content like terrorism.
For the full list of disallowed content according to the TOS, please refer to Discord’s website. If you post any of the specified content, you will receive an instant ban.
  
### B. Harassment or Targeted Attacks
The following constitute harassment or targeted attacks:
- Hot button words (i.e. slurs) used in hateful contexts or hinted to be used (“baited”) to get a rise out of someone or to make a tasteless joke/punchline about a heated topic.
- Incitement of heated argument about topics like serious current events, race, religion, politics, sexuality, gender identity, disability, or other minority groups.
- Repeated and/or forceful interactions with another user or mod that aim to negatively affect said person (“bullying”).
If you display behavior specified above, you will receive a warning for your first violation and a ban for repeated violations.
  
### C. Not Safe For Work (NSFW)
The following types of content are considered NSFW and are NOT ALLOWED IN ANY CHANNEL:
- Visual pornography: images, gifs, and videos of genitals, boobs, butts, sexual activity, and otherwise sexually suggestive imagery — whether they be animated or live action, censored or uncensored, lightly covered or cropped. No matter how you try to obscure the origin of what you're posting, someone hornier KNOWS and they WILL point it out.
- Written erotica: images, gifs, videos, text posts, copypasta, or links to explicit writing.
- Fetish content: disallowed even without excessive nudity or violence, as long as there is clear sexual intent or sexualization of otherwise benign subjects/objects.
- Excessive violence: gore, displays of violent crime, disgusting/gross-out content. A good rule of thumb is that if you wouldn’t see it in a PG-13 movie, don’t post it.
If you post any of these, you’ll receive a warning for your first violation and a ban for repeated violations. Presence of these types of content in your PROFILE PICTURE, HEADER, USERNAME, NICKNAME, BIO, or CUSTOM STATUS will be subject to the same punishment.

### D. Spam
We define spam as follows:
- Unsolicited server invites
- Self-promotion of any kind
- Irrelevant walls of text, file uploads, or excessively long links
- Notification spam and copious @user/@role pings
- Any repetitive postings that overtake the channel or disrupt ongoing conversations
If you post any of the content specified above, you will receive a warning for your first violation and a ban for repeated violations.

### E. Off-Topic
Off-topic refers to any content that doesn't belong in the channel where it was posted, thus interrupting ongoing conversations. Good principles to avoid off-topic posts:
- Respect ongoing conversations. Don’t just butt in with a completely different topic by ignoring what other people are talking about.
- Point out when a conversation is veering into off-topic territory, and respectfully suggest moving to another channel, taking it to DMs, or stopping entirely. Crucially, only speak out once. If you are ignored, it's time to approach a mod. If a mod is part of the problem, approach a different mod.
- When a mod says a conversation is getting off-topic or inappropriate, and suggests to move channels, move to DMs, or stop the conversation — listen to them. You don't have to respect or even like the mods, but listen anyway.

# Mod Guidelines

### G1: Rules
1A - The server rules that apply to our users apply to us as well. No one gets a "rule pass."

1B - Topics discussed in mod channels remain in mod channels. Spreading around contents of mod channels to anyone who is not already in them is a serious infraction punishable by an instant demod, no questions asked.

1C - Respect each channel's purpose. Only use announcement channels for important things (and only ping people for super important, urgent things). Limit the use of images, links, and other media in any channels with fast convos.

### G2: Power
2A - Don't flaunt your power, threaten anyone with your power, moderate based on your preferences, or dominate regular users' conversations unless you actually care what they have to say.

2B - Don't make changes alone. Wait for other mods to give feedback. Major decisions must be voted on, with a 24 hour voting window for urgent decisions, and a 7 day voting window for other big/long-term changes. If you find yourself alone during an emergency (like a raid), then pester every other staff member until at least one other person responds.

2C - Be impartial. Don't treat one user's word as better than another. Ask for proof to inform your decisions, but KEEP IT PRIVATE. Don't spread around other users' dirty laundry.

### G3: Participation
3A -  Always make sure to vote. If you can pop in to send a single message to public chats during a busy day, you can cast a quick emoji reaction vote for mod policies.

3B - Inform yourself even at the barest minimum level about the server rules and bot commands. If you don't even know how Discord, its permissions, or the server bots work, you are not fit for moderating a Discord server; simple as that. You cannot have power in a digital space if you are ignorant about how the tech works. Follow existing protocols for dealing with rulebreakers and giving punishment, unless you can give a good reason for making an exception.

3C - We all have personal lives; it's okay not to always be available. Just briefly and quietly inform other mods of your situation, an estimation of how long you need to be away (or if you wanna quit), and direct any user who approaches you to a mod who is more active.

3D - No need to compete with other mods or have a "specialty" to be useful. Stick to basics (warnings, answering questions, discussing with other staff), unless there's a set of duties you feel isn't done, and you think you can do it.

**Demod:** get 3 strikes or have more than half the mod team vote to demod you.
