__**Content Policy**__

Content which is NOT ALLOWED in the server will be defined in the following categories:
a) Illegal or against the Discord Terms of Service — breaks Rule 1 (“Respect the service that we use”)
b) Harassment or Targeted Attacks  — breaks Rule 2 (“Respect other members of the server”)
c) Not Safe For Work — breaks Rule 3 (“Respect the purpose of each channel”)
d) Spam — breaks Rule 3 (“Respect the purpose of each channel”)
e) Off-Topic — breaks Rule 3 (“Respect the purpose of each channel”)

**A. Illegal or against Discord TOS**
A common but *non-exhaustive* list of content that violates Discord’s Terms of Service, and is therefore not allowed in this server:
- Doxxing, or leaking other people’s personal information without their permission. As for handling your own personal info, you are encouraged not to reveal more than necessary in order to *keep yourself safe*.
- Organization of raids, both in the sense of raiding this server or using this server as a place to communicate about raiding other places. This is considered brigading.
- Posting of illegal content including but not limited to IRL gore, animal abuse, sexual abuse, sexualization and exploitation of minors, trading in black markets, and violent crime-related content like terrorism.
For the full list of disallowed content according to the TOS, please refer to Discord’s website. If you post any of the specified content, you will receive an instant ban.
‎
**B. Harassment or Targeted Attacks**
The following constitute harassment or targeted attacks:
- Hot button words (i.e. slurs) used in hateful contexts or hinted to be used (“baited”) to get a rise out of someone or to make a tasteless joke/punchline about a heated topic.
- Incitement of heated argument about topics like serious current events, race, religion, politics, sexuality, gender identity, or minority groups.
- Repeated and/or forceful interactions with another user or mod that aim to negatively affect said person (“bullying”).
If you display behavior specified above, you will receive a warning for your first violation and a ban for repeated violations.
‎
**C. Not Safe For Work (NSFW)**
The following types of content are considered NSFW and are NOT ALLOWED IN ANY CHANNEL:
- Visual pornography: images, gifs, and videos of genitals, boobs, butts, sexual activity, and otherwise sexually suggestive imagery — whether they be animated or live action, censored or uncensored, lightly covered or cropped.
- Written erotica: images, gifs, videos, text posts, copypasta, or links to explicit writing.
- Fetish content: disallowed even without excessive nudity or violence as long as there is clear sexual intent or sexualization of otherwise benign subjects.
- Excessive violence: gore, displays of violent crime, disgusting/gross-out content. A good rule of thumb is that if you wouldn’t see it in a PG-13 movie, don’t post it.
If you post any of these, you’ll receive a warning for your first violation and a ban for repeated violations. Presence of these types of content in your PROFILE PICTURE, HEADER, USERNAME, NICKNAME, or CUSTOM STATUS will be subject to the same punishment.
‎
**D. Spam**
Our definition of spam is as follows:
- Unsolicited server invites (i.e. people didn’t ask for them as they came up in conversation)
- Self-promotion of any kind
- Irrelevant walls of text, excessively long links, irrelevant file uploads
- Notification spam or irrelevant @user/@role pings
- Any postings, often repetitive, that overtake the channel they are posted in or disrupt ongoing conversations
If you post any of the content specified above, you will receive a warning for your first violation and a ban for repeated violations.
‎
**E. Off-Topic**
Off-topic content is posts that do not belong in the channel where it was posted and interrupt ongoing conversations. Some good rules of thumb to avoid or deal with off-topic posts in any channel:
- Respect ongoing conversations. Don’t just butt in with a completely different topic by ignoring what people are talking about.
- Point out when a conversation is veering into off-topic territory, and respectfully suggest moving to another channel.
- When a mod says a conversation is getting off-topic or inappropriate, and suggests to move channels, move to DMs, or stop the conversation — listen to them.
